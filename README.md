# Introduction-to-Computational-Intelligence

This repository contains the code and documentation for two projects completed during the "Introduction to Computational Intelligence" course in fall 2020. The projects explore different aspects of computational intelligence, including simulating learning and pattern recognition in the human brain with a linear memory and implementing the Single-Layer Perceptron algorithm for AND, OR, and XNOR logic gates.

## Project 1: Simulating Learning and Recognizing Patterns in the Human Brain

This project aims to simulate the behavior of the brain in learning input data. In the human brain, the learning process involves taking in input data through the senses and adapting to produce desired outputs. This project explores the simulation of this learning process, particularly with a focus on linear memory. The code and report (in Farsi) are available in the perceptron_algorithm directory

## Project 2: Implementation of Single-Layer Perceptron Algorithm

This project involves the implementation of the Single-Layer Perceptron algorithm for AND, OR, and XNOR logic gates. The focus is on understanding the principles of neural networks and their application in solving simple logic problems. The code and report (in Farsi) are available in the perceptron_algorithm directory
